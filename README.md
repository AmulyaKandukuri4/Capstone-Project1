# Capstone-Project1

Introduction
This Capstone project will combine what you have learned in the preceding courses on SQL, Spreadsheets, and Tableau. 
The project includes 2 main parts with subtasks inside:

Data Exploration and Analysis using SQL, Spreadsheets and Tableau
Presentation of your findings and insights.
You will work individually on the first project part and in a small team of  4 students on the second part of the project.

Project Background
The online sector has been slowly eating up market share in the past two decades. 
E-commerce platforms like Unicorn allow people to buy products online: from books, toys, clothes, and shoes to food, furniture, and other household items. The following dataset includes Unicorn sales data from the years 2015-2018.

Let's suppose that the Unicorn is a family business and is owned by 2 owners who are very invested in their business. 
They already have a small data analytics team but want to expand it significantly next few months. They see you as a candidate for DA position and provide you sample dataset from their sales data.

Your task is to analyze the data, find interesting insights and identify weak areas and opportunities for Unicorn to boost business growth.

In the first part of the project, before you dive deeper into your own unguided data research, Unicorn ask you to answer the following questions by SQL querying.
This task is done individually. Query the DB and write down your queries in a doc to ensure you have collected them all into one place. Once completed, start SQL quiz here on Campus and copy your queries.
After you submit the quiz, you will get a Unicorn's DA team version of working queries. 

How many Customers do we have in the data?
What was the city with the most profit for the company in 2015 and how much was it?
How many different cities do we have in the data?
Show the total spent by customers from low to high.
What is the most profitable City in the State of Tennessee?
What’s the average annual profit for that city across all years in that city?
What is the distribution of customer types in the data?
What’s the most profitable product category on average in Iowa across all years?
What is the most popular product in that category across all states in 2016?
Which customer got the most discount in the data? (in total amount)
How widely did monthly profits vary in 2018?
Which order was the highest in 2015?
What was the rank of each city in the East region in 2015?
Join all DB tables into one dataset that includes all unique columns and download it as a csv file. 
In the second part of the project, you're gonna work with this one table.

Spreadsheets
In the last question of the SQL part you wrote a query that joined all 4 tables in one dataset. 
Save this table in a csv format and open it in a Spreadsheet program of your choice.
The following tasks are a minimum requirement for the Spreadsheets part of the project. we highly recommend you build additional dashboards and visualizations that effectively communicate your findings and will allow the Unicorn DA team to monitor their data daily.

Open a new tab in your Spreadsheet tool and create a table that is filtered dynamically by year.
Use your filtered table to create a “Profit per year” dashboard. In that dashboard, you can choose a year and all the data should change dynamically.
Your dashboard should contain at least the following:
A histogram of the profit column with a bucket size of 20 and an outlier percentile of 5%
A chart that shows the profit over the months (you could do a line chart or a waterfall chart). Note: the months should be ordered in the right order!
Top 5 profitable subcategories
Bottom 5 profitable subcategories
Top 10 profitable customers
Bottom 10 profitable customers
  3. Along with the charts, your dashboard should include some numbers (which should change dynamically by year too):

Sum of positive profit
Sum of negative profit
Number of distinct orders
Tableau
This part of the project is open-ended. Its goal is to communicate your insights clearly, about the data to the Unicorn's executive team.
Here we provide a list of questions that Unicorn might be interested in answering with the help of your dashboards:

What is the most profitable City in the State of Tennessee?
What’s the average annual profit for that city across all years in that city?
What’s the most profitable product category on average in Iowa across all years?”
What is the most popular product in that category across all states in 2016?
What was the most profitable month in 2018 overall?
How widely did monthly profits vary in 2018?
The above list of questions is only a suggestion to start with. There are more questions you can think about and advance or build additional dashboards.
Remember that Unicorn want to grow their business and see how sales data can help them to make the right decisions.
